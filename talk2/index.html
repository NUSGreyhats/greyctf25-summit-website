			<p>Introduction to Fuzzing</p>

			<p class="x">~ talk sypnosis</p>

			<p>Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique used to uncover security vulnerabilities in software such as operating systems and network protocols, before they can be exploited by an attacker.</p>

			<p>In this presentation, we will cover the core principles of fuzzing, and how it goes beyond generating random inputs to detect deeper flaws in real-world applications to allow us to more effectively patch and protect our software and systems. We will also share some perspectives on a career as a cybersecurity researcher in DSO National Laboratories.</p>
