			<p>Ever wondered what it’s like to run a massive international CTF as a student club?</p>

			<p>Join us as we pull back the curtain on GreyCTF —  from brainstorming challenge ideas and building them, to managing the chaos and caffeine-fueled nights that make it all happen.</p>

			<p>And of course, we’ll walk you through some of our favorite challenges from the finals — sharing the thought process, the tricky parts, and a few fun surprises along the way.</p>
