<p class="x">~ getting to COM1 by public transport (recommended!)</p>

<p>1. Take the MRT to Kent Ridge Station (circle line).</p>

<p>2. Exit from the station via Exit A.</p>

<p>3. Walk via the underpass to get to "Opposite Kent Ridge Station Exit A" bus stop.</p>

<p>4. Take Bus D2 until COM3. <i>(the bus might take awhile since it is a weekend!)</i></p>

<p><i>(the bus driver may ask to show a NUS student pass. if you are not a NUS student, kindly inform the bus driver that you are going to GreyCTF summit and show them the confirmation email if necessary!)</i></p>

<p>5. We have a video on how to walk to COM1 from the COM3 bus stop on our instagram!</p>

<b><p>If you are driving and parking in NUS, there are a few carparks around NUS subjected to availability and parking fees will apply.</p></b>
